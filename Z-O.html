		"capital letters are just one of society's conventions that I choose to ignore. you've just been programmed to be one of society. you're a sheep."




		A popular speaker started off a seminar by holding up a $20 bill. A crOwd of 200 had gathered to hear him speak. He asked, “Who would like this $20 bill?”

200 haNds weNt up.He said, “I am gOing to give this $20 tO oNe of you but first, let me do this.” He crumpled the bill up.

He theN asked, “WhO still wants it?” All 200 hands were still raised   “Well,” he replied, “What if I dO 

this?” TheN he dropped the bill oN the grouNd aNd stOmped oN it with his shoes.He picked it up, aNd showed 

	it tO the crOwd. The bill was all crumpled aNd dirty.“Now who still waNts it?”All the haNds still went up.

	“My friends, I have just showed yOu a very impOrtant lessOn. nO matter what I did to the moNey, you 

	still waNted it because it did nOt decrease in value. It was still wOrth $20. MaNy times iN Our lives, 

	life crumples us aNd griNds us iNto the dirt. We make bad decisioNs or deal with poor circumstaNces. 

	We feel wOrthless. But No matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your 

	value. You are special – Don’t ever forget it
	

	a stylistic choice in which all text is in lowercase letters. it can be thought of as the opposite of 

	writing in all caps when emphasizing a point, in which case it can be used to give a melancholic feel 

to whatever you're writing. it is not generally thought of as orthographically correct, giving it (if only 

in the eyes of advertisers) a casual, hip feel. also used in a visual narrative sense to indicate 	
		childishness or, in some cases, idiocy.

	

	on a more dark note, however, this trope also has a tendency to show up in many an apocalyptic log	

	where it usually is used to denote the point where the unfortunate author has gone insane or otherwise 

	given up all hope.


can also occur in internet forums monitored by censorship daemons programmed to demote all-caps entries, 


	since all-lower-case text is much easier on the eyes than no-lower-case.
